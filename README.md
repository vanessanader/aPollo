Final year project, American University of Beirut.

This iOS Application was created for my final year project. My colleagues created a web app that complements it.
Here is the abstract:

In order to remedy the loss of focus of students and their inability to follow what is being explained in class at certain occurrences, we propose an interactive learning system that would enhance communication between professors and students. 
This is done through four features: polls, attendance taking, a periodic review and student questions. S
tudents can use these features through an iOS app and professors through a web application.


Database used is Firebase. Push Notifications implemented with Firebase Cloud Messaging.
MSAL was used for authentication.

All pods can be found in the Podfile.

Don't forget to add your own GoogleService-Info.plist file and necessary credentials to make it run!
